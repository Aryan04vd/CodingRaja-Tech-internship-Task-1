This project is a web-based resume builder implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface consists of a navigation bar, an input form section for personal details such as name, contact information, and a preview section displaying a live preview of the resume. The form includes dynamic repeaters for achievements, experiences, education, projects, and skills, implemented using the jQuery Repeater plugin. Users can add, remove, and edit these sections with instant updates to the live preview. The application encourages a user-friendly experience with a straightforward design, and it allows users to print the generated CV. The code structure is modular, making use of external libraries for jQuery and the repeater functionality, and it emphasizes dynamic content generation for an interactive and efficient resume-building process.
